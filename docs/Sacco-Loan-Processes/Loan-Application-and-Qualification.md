# Loan Application and Qualification

## *Introduction*

## Loan Application

A loan application is the process where a borrower formally asks a lender (like a bank, SACCO, or fintech platform) for money.  
It’s basically the borrower saying, “Here’s who I am, how much I need, and why I can pay it back.”

**It usually includes:**

- **Personal info:** name, ID, income, employment details.  
- **Loan details:** amount requested, purpose, repayment period.  
- **Supporting documents:** payslips, bank statements, collateral info, etc.

The lender uses this to decide whether to consider the borrower and what type of loan fits them.

## Loan Qualification

Loan qualification is the stage where the lender evaluates whether the applicant meets the requirements to receive the loan.  
It’s the lender asking, “Can this person be trusted to repay us?”

**The qualification process checks:**

- **Creditworthiness:** based on credit score or repayment history.  
- **Debt-to-income ratio:** can they afford the loan with their current income?  
- **Collateral value:** if the loan is secured.  
- **Compliance:** does the loan follow internal policies and regulations?

If the applicant passes all these checks, the lender says the borrower is *qualified* — and the loan can move forward for approval and disbursement.

### In short:
- **Loan application** = borrower requests the loan.  
- **Loan qualification** = lender verifies if the borrower deserves it.
