Enter the **Member No.** and **Loan No.** fields. The system will automatically populate the list of current guarantors.

### Step 3: Select and Substitute Guarantors

Select the guarantor to be substituted, then choose the new guarantor to replace them. The balance for the outgoing guarantor will be cleared, and the new guarantor will inherit the corresponding guarantee amount.
