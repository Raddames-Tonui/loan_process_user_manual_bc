# Loan Rescheduling, Refinancing, and Top-Up

> **Note:** The sample system does not currently support loan rescheduling or refinancing.

## Loan Top-Up/ Loan Bridging

A **loan top-up** occurs when a member with an existing loan applies for a new loan of the same type. The new loan amount is used to clear the balance of the old loan, and the remaining funds are disbursed to the member.

In this sample scenario, the member already has an outstanding  **FOSA Makao Loan**  of **KES 183,764.33**. When the same member applies for a new loan of **KES 400,000**, the system automatically offsets the existing balance and combines it into the new consolidated loan.
